    <p>
      As he walked down the black-cobbled street, he marked the faces of the
      people, pallid and glacial, as they watched the reddening of the sky.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite its periodic return, their eyes betrayed the fresh terror that
      accompanied each cycle. Some immediately dropped to the rites of the blood
      sky, as it was known, clutching tokens and artifacts and muttering in the
      old tongue, invoking its twisted, percussive consonants and intermingled
      vowels in menacing incantations. Others focused downward, waving
      multi-pronged tools lit with acid-green fires over reagents hastily thrown
      over the blackened stone. They wielded various instruments whose intricate
      designs told the story of centuries.
    </p>

    <p>
      He pulled his ill-fitting, ragged cloak tighter around him and quickened
      his pace. He brought an edge to cover his mouth, which drooped to one
      side, exposing a corner of his yellow teeth. His mouth was framed by black
      stains, remnants of the foul drug that all initiates consumed as
      preparation for their last rite into the Speaker’s Order. It left his
      mouth slightly numb, giving it the hint of an expression of boredom or
      contempt.
    </p>

    <p>
      The blood sky had arrived early, catching him by surprise. As he weaved
      his way through the crowd, he observed he was not the only one. Besides
      those who began the rites, he saw others in the street market caught
      mid-trade, one pair still grasping the same red, jagged dart that served
      as currency in this district, catatonic while they beheld the sky. The
      Initiate wondered what was going through their mind as they prepared for
      what came next, whether they felt a morbid pride in their duty, or simple
      terror at transforming into our other creatures and heading into the
      Depths for a week of receiving and inflicting torturous pain.
    </p>

    <p>
      He was protected for the first time in his life. Four long years of
      isolation, daily self-flagellation, sacrifices of blood and constant study
      of history, philosophy, and theology. The final trial – consuming the
      black fluids that formed the city’s innermost river – had left a permanent
      mark. The drug, prepared for decades by the apothecaries, caused
      delusional visions of the mind akin to the horrors of the Depths. It
      lasted for days, and by the time he emerged from his stupor, he had
      witnessed his deepest fears played before him in excruciating detail for
      what seemed like an eternity.
    </p>

    <p>
      But as an initiate into the Speaker’s Order, he was spared the yearly
      transformation signaled by the blood sky, what some call the Omni Mutatio,
      or the Inversion, or the Rip Skin, or the Rebirth – there were endless
      names for it. Instead, he and the other Speakers would communicate with
      the demon clergy, known as Elders, who received divine command from the
      almighty Domitorem itself. This was the contract his people made at the
      beginning of history: the Domitorem and its demons from the other realms
      provide guidance, revelation, purpose and protection, and in exchange, the
      people of the city of First Child serve their tours in the Depths. Only a
      small group of “Speakers” would be kept lucid at all times to ensure the
      will of the Domitorem was done.
    </p>

    <p>
      As much as he tried to suppress it, he was overwhelmed with a feeling of
      relief. Every citizen besides a Speaker had to serve. Of course, it was an
      open secret that some privileged people who made secret deals with the
      Elders, providing them all manners of horrors to serve their clandestine
      goals, were given special protections and spared their tours in the
      Depths. He was not so fortunate.
    </p>

    <p>
      Being 19, he had only served four times, as all citizens of the city must
      serve once they reach the age of 15. The memories were tricky, as the
      transformation changed everything about the sense, but what little he
      remembered haunted him every night. His consciousness would go from
      receiving one type of input – smells, sights, sounds – to combinations of
      them layered with sensations he had never experienced. He could feel every
      piece of the air around him as if it were made of particles gently
      swaying, then jostled around as objects moved about in space. Rays would
      form in oblong patterns before him, not in any way he could see, but in
      ways that he interpreted as a type of distance-measuring sense. And beyond
      the difference in type of sense, it also overwhelmed in sheer volume. It
      was a relentless, staccato eruption of alien sensation.
    </p>

    <p>
      But when the senses resolved, and his overstressed mind had a moment of
      lucidity, he could see the fringes of what he supposed were the tasks set
      before them in the labyrinthine Depths.
    </p>

    <p>It was suffering and pain.</p>

    <p>
      He remembered being cut open from top to bottom, down his limbs, across
      his scalp, and opened, his skin peeled back to reveal blood-slick muscle
      beneath – then singed on every nerve with instruments tipped with
      white-hot fires wielded by unrecognizable creatures, their faces a
      swirling mass of ripping flesh while a viscous black liquid streamed down
      in waves. His organs were sliced open, pulled apart and healed with forces
      he didn’t understand, then reconstituted and inserted back in. And he
      would feel it all, regardless of how deconstructed he became.
    </p>

    <p>
      And if he wasn’t being tortured, he was the one torturing. Even worse, in
      the form of the demon he became, he <em>wanted to</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      No one knew the exact location of the Depths, though many assumed it
      resided somewhere between the Domitorem’s realm and our own. And despite
      much speculation about the mechanics of the transformation and its
      purpose, there was little conclusive fact. Some believed that the citizens
      of First Child helped fight a war against the Domitorem’s enemies, perhaps
      to bring the same revelation and purpose it brought us. Others claim they
      served as subjects for the learnings of the Domitorem, so that it may find
      greater truths about the fabrics of reality. Still others claimed there is
      no purpose at all, and that the Depths were a realm of pure chaos.
      Regardless of the truth, the Elders have never revealed what the
      transformation is and what purpose it serves in the Depths.
    </p>

    <p>
      As he emerged from the cluster of buildings that bordered the street
      market, the statue known as the Tribute at the city’s center was framed
      perfectly. In the dreary red haze, four of its jagged, burnt red
      appendages thrust outwards in aggressive angles, forming the base of a
      tower that would ultimately rise above the clouds. The body of the tower
      depicted the Domitorem itself, and although no human had ever communicated
      with the Domitorem directly, its image was everywhere in the city and
      ingrained in the minds of the people of First Child.
    </p>

    <p>
      The margins of the Domitorem were the first thing the mind comprehended,
      having sharp protrusions running along its perimeter that stuck through
      complex webs intertwining in sharp patterns. The webs wrapped a bulging
      mass in the center that spilled through in drooling trails down its side
      and into its many legs, surrounding it like a curled centipede. The
      bulging mass and web rose upwards, flanked by demonic runes that even a
      Speaker did not have the privilege to understand. At the top was what many
      considered the “head,” which had a white cover tightly pulled over a
      vaguely spherical object. Through the cover, one could see a dozen holes
      near the top, and a single large hole near the bottom, creating
      indentations in the cloth that created pitch-black shadows. Above the
      Domitorem would rise a double-helix of bones and the prepared corpses of
      citizens and demons collected from sacrifices in the Depths. Ultimately,
      this double-helix would twist into the sky far beyond the sight, into
      realms higher than any human had ever been, but for now, the people of the
      city were still working on the first tier of the helix, one strand rising
      slightly above the other. There remained generations – tens of generations
      – of work.
    </p>

    <p>
      His route to the Elder would take him down the long path that followed the
      river Kultata. There were five rivers in the city of First Child, which
      formed perfect circles that circumscribed the city center in progressive
      rings. They formed natural hierarchies between the various guilds that
      governed each district of the city, the ones being closer to the center
      being more important and influential. The river Kultata was the second
      from the city center and bordered the Apothecary Guild district on its
      inner side, where he now walked. The river had a luster like oil, being a
      solid, jet black, but glowed bright as it reflected the sun, refracting
      the light to give it’s own purples, greens and yellows. It flowed with a
      substance more viscous and less dense than water, which meant it was
      impossible to swim in. However you flailed or struggled, regardless of how
      well you swam in water – if you fell into the river, you were sucked
      under, your arms and legs unable to push yourself in a liquid so weak. He
      never walked <em>too</em> close to the edge.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond the city walls was a wasteland. Attempts in ancient times to settle
      outside the city met with universal failure. If it wasn’t the the dead
      soil, the constant storms or the all-encompassing fog, it was vicious
      predators perfectly adapted to the harshness of the environment and
      scouring every corner of the badlands. Instead, small pockets of
      agriculture existed within the city, especially among the Cornmongers
      Guild, supplemented by food provided by the Elder’s demon servants. From
      where they got the food, he didn’t know and didn’t want to. Still, the
      average citizen of First Child went hungry most days.
    </p>

    <p>
      He walked beside the river until the light began to fade and the path
      became more narrow, signaling that he was getting close to the edge of the
      Apothecary Guild district, where the Elder resided. When he looked up at
      the houses along the path, he could see the changes happening to the
      people already – those who watched the sky grew longer, scaly features;
      their eyes grew wide and vicious; their arms and legs wilted like they
      were left in the sun to rot, leaving only gnarled limbs like tree branches
      tipped with claws, their skin scabbed and covered in pus that ran from
      sickly brown boils. Their gazes, he could feel, moved gradually from the
      sky and onto him, the pits of their eyes shining in the background of
      pitch. They would soon be leaving their houses to join the others heading
      for the Depths. He turned his eyes away from the others and towards the
      ornate, looming building of the Elder, which could be seen from miles
      away.
    </p>

    <p>
      The transformed others started to fill the paths, waiting in line to enter
      one of the many activated gates that dotted the public spaces across the
      city. He had never seen them active before. They were twisted, pockmarked
      horseshoes made of rusted iron, but in their dormant state contained
      nothing in the middle. Walking through one would do nothing – not that
      anyone would ever try. People kept as much distance as they could from the
      foreboding metal gates.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now that the gate was active, the center was pitch black. Red tendrils
      reached from inside to grip the edges, pulsing and straining as if it were
      holding onto the gate with all of its might. Other tendrils wrapped the
      citizens as they entered the gate to pull them into the Depths. He saw the
      transformed citizens mauling each other as they stood in line, using their
      massive claws to rake the backs of the creatures in front, mouths open and
      fangs bared, tearing flesh. Other demons – servants of the Domitorem –
      carried long stakes made out of what looked like charcoal that they used
      to stop fights between the citizens, stabbing them apart before they did
      too much damage to each other. They didn’t get them all, however, as some
      of the citizens ripped each other apart too quickly, clawing into each
      other’s bellies and eating them from the inside, piles of gore developing
      on the edges of the crowd like the froth of a low tide.
    </p>

    <p>
      The demons policing the line looked similar to the transformed citizens,
      having the same wilted, lanky appendages, flaky, blemished brown skin and
      giant heads, their mouths filled with inch-long fangs that were always
      visible. Their ears were each the size of their already freakishly large
      head, giving him the impression of a provoked reptile about to strike.
    </p>

    <p>
      He felt a drop on his exposed hand, then another. A rain began, escalating
      quickly from a gentle shower. It reflected the red sky like beads of
      blood, the clouds darkening as the moisture in the air coalesced into a
      storm. As the water began to pool around bodies of the dead, long, thin
      strands of red flowed through the channels of the cobblestone street like
      fresh watercolor, the gruesome art of the citizens’ new forms.
    </p>

    <p>
      As he approached the Elder’s tower, he saw how the extravagant
      architecture served less for shelter and more as a display of dominion and
      unmitigated power over all else. It stood at least triple the height of
      the nearest building, boasting balconies, towers, exposed staircases, and
      outcroppings that brooded directly over its neighbors. While the
      indication of engravings covered every visible surface, the exact details
      seemed to fight the sense, slowly moving and merging as if it knew it was
      being seen. As soon as it looked like one thing, it seemed to subtly shift
      until it looked nothing like that at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      Walls of twisted vine and thorn obstructed the view of whatever courtyard
      the inhabitants tended, which he followed until he reached a tall metal
      gate. It too had filigree that seemed to shift and undermine the sense,
      with the exception of a large, multi-sided polygon in concentric circles
      placed directly in the middle.
    </p>

    <p>
      He walked within a foot of the gates and stood, looking through. The low
      sun, peering through a gap in the clouds, cast oblique, red rays over the
      edges of the building’s gnarled features, illuminating the rain as it fell
      in a dull light. He saw no activity within, hearing nothing but the sound
      of falling rain on stone.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a moment, he heard a loud click and watched the gate unhinge itself
      and open, drawing itself inward as if it was inhaling. He carefully
      stepped through and followed the only path to the door.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the streets outside were poorly cobbled, this was much worse. Rock
      jutted in such severe and random directions that it was painful to walk
      on, and the fact they were all colored the same light-sucking pitch made
      it difficult to negotiate his footing. He assumed it was intentional. One
      more way to keep the Speakers in their place.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lining the path were multiple “structures” made from the bodies of imps –
      small, angular creatures with razor-sharp claws and 2 inch fangs. They had
      tufts of mottled fur on the ends of their tails and ears, along with
      patches over the body. They were bent and broken along the path to form
      arcane symbols, as if they formed a ward – or a curse. One symbol formed a
      circumscribed triangle with 6 imps on end, skewered down the middle on
      curved metal hooks, their limbs stretched, twisted, and clamped to other
      limbs by compressing a black metal instrument that looked like a bed of
      nails pushing through either side. Dried blood caked around the wounds and
      wove downwards in rivulets, long blackened from time. While he had no love
      for the mischievous creatures, who could be found in the dark corners of
      the city in roaming bands, he took no pleasure in seeing them treated with
      such cruelty. He tried not to look at them, though they seemed to bear
      down on him as if feeling his aversion.
    </p>

    <p>
      The path itself grew narrower – the arch covering the pathway drawing
      closer and the margins of the path shrinking – until he could even feel
      protrusions from the imp structures raking at his robe, sharp claw-points
      and limbs pulling at the faded cloth so that he began to angle himself
      sideways, the better to slip through.
    </p>

    <p>
      As he approached the door, resting beneath an arch filled with the same
      sinister inscriptions and covered again with the symbol he saw on the
      gate, he lifted his hand to grip the massive metal object hanging from the
      door, covered in sharp points in radial patterns that made it impossible
      to wield without pain, and colored with the same indistinct darkness as
      the path that made it difficult to judge the depth and position of the
      door-knocker.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before he could touch it, the door swung violently open, sending the metal
      object flailing, and landing with a full-bodied <em>thud</em> against its
      cradle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Standing directly before him was a pathetic looking creature about half
      his height, its back curved so sharply it looked pained as it angled its
      head up to face him. It looked humanoid – with all of the appropriate
      appendages that one would expect – though that was where the similarities
      ended.
    </p>

    <p>
      Its ears curled up and inwards like dried flower petals – wrinkled and
      flaky. Its nose protruded far forwards and down, covering the center of
      its lipless mouth, two scaly flaps of skin that terminated against long,
      yellow black teeth that extended from its mouth in myriad directions. Its
      eyes were unsettling in size – large pits with shimmering black globes
      sunken deep into the skull, with small, bright red points that darted from
      his face to his body and back again. Its skin, matching what the citizens
      of the city now had, looked wrinkled and atrophied, alternating between a
      deep brown and a putrid yellow mixture, obscured by scales and inky
      blemishes.
    </p>

    <p>
      It curled its lips back in a tight snarl as it spoke to him in raspy,
      broken breaths, making it difficult to understand as its sentences
      faltered. He had heard it said that the creatures from the Elder’s domain
      never spoke as such – its languages were carried on other mediums than air
      – so it looked as unnatural in its mouth as it sounded, its long black
      tongue clicking its teeth as it formed the syllables.
    </p>

    <p>
      “You are <em>late</em>,” it said.
    </p>

    <p>“The sky grows red before its time. I am here to–”</p>

    <p>
      “You have no more time than–” it paused to rearrange its tongue in its
      mouth, “–than what the <em>Elder</em> provides.”
    </p>

    <p>“Then I submit myself for judgment.”</p>

    <p>
      “You <em>submit</em> – yourself.”
    </p>

    <p>The Initiate bowed low.</p>

    <p>
      “<em>Come</em> – with <em>me</em>.”
    </p>

    <p>
      The creature turned on its heel, grabbing a torch mounted near the door
      and revealing a long, limp tail hanging flatly against its side, a train
      the Initiate dared not step on.
    </p>

    <p>
      He followed the creature into what seemed like utter darkness with oases
      of light in the form of lonely torches, providing the only islands of
      reality in what seemed like an endless nothing. As they parted the
      darkness, strange figures emerged on the edge, just beyond his sight. He
      saw limbs – at least, he thought they were limbs – undulate in and out of
      the illuminated radius, just enough to log the sense, but not defined
      enough to assign it any profile he could recognize. The sheen of eyes
      appeared briefly and left; elongated, black objects swooped in from above
      and darted out again; and strange <em>clack clack</em> noises, similar to
      the sound of teeth of the creature ahead of him, though from elsewhere.
    </p>

    <p>
      While they had been in a space too large for the light to reach the edges,
      they soon approached a small archway in the wall made of stone. Through
      it, he could see the hint of spiral stairs leading downwards.
    </p>

    <p>
      “We go – to the <em>council</em> now.
    </p>

    <p>
      They are <em>speaking</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Know</em> – your place,” it said without turning to face him.
    </p>

    <p>
      He followed the creature downwards past featureless walls, the steps
      narrow and steep, causing the Initiate to hold the wall to ensure he had
      purchase on the next step, partially obscured by their meager source of
      light, and the fact that darkness licked at his back as the creature
      advanced away from him, its tail curling around the spiral like a dead
      vine clinging to the thick base of an Oak.
    </p>

    <p>
      They walked in silence. As they descended, the Initiate could not mark the
      time. His legs grew weary from the careful shuffle he had adopted so as
      not to fall forwards on his guide or accidentally step on its tail, and
      his hands grew dry and chafed from following the rough surface of the
      stairway wall. But he would walk without complaint until his body failed,
      and he collapsed.
    </p>

    <p>
      He began to hear muffled voices – so soft he wasn't sure they weren’t
      figments of the darkness that consumed them – until it echoed in the
      narrow walls around them in a tinny, reverberating din punctuated by a
      louder, deeper voice that resonated in the stone. The voices grew louder
      and louder until he saw a hint of light coming from down below – the exit
      of the stairs.
    </p>

    <p>
      He entered a room grander in size than he expected underground. It defied
      space. Countless lines of torches followed upwards but soon broke into
      curves inwards, outwards and around. The walls undulated as the lights
      flickered, and he could see only the faintest image of the ceiling, though
      that was enough to know that it was covered in the same shifting, dense
      mass of what seemed shapes and objects he could not conceive of – their
      edges curling in, rays intersecting at impossible angles, and interwoven
      into textures of such complexity and obscured by such distance that they
      were inscrutable to him.
    </p>

    <p>
      He walked in without the reaction of any before him – for if they noticed
      his entrance, they betrayed no sign of it – when the guide grabbed him by
      the arm, its claws easily covering its circumference and digging
      forcefully into the muscle, and pointed to an empty seat at the edge of
      one of the occupied tables. The Initiate walked quietly to the empty seat
      next to the other speakers. He then saw his guide turn around and walk
      slowly back up the stairs.
    </p>

    <p>
      The occupants of the room were immersed in debate. On the right, where the
      creature had directed him, were wooden tables where the Speakers sat, low
      to the ground in a semicircle pattern facing the left, the chairs made of
      curving stone in a design he wasn’t entirely sure were meant to
      accommodate a human body.
    </p>

    <p>
      Across from him sat the Elder high in an ornate stage – curving, blackened
      stone twisting to form a peak – sitting in a chair who’s back sat tall
      behind it, angled downwards towards the assembled Speakers before him. The
      structure that formed the stage was decorated with the bodies of creatures
      – not simply imps, as was the case in the entrance – but all manner of
      creatures from the Elder’s realm; ghastly visages twisted in what he could
      only imagine was pain, its limbs interlocking with meticulous cruelty to
      form more of the ancient demonscript, most broken or covered in viscera,
      and only partially obscuring the illuminated engravings that seemed to
      depict the very scene he now observed. It culminated in the peak that now
      framed the Elder, which was flanked by two large fires that, while its
      edges looked like the orange and yellow blaze that he knew well, contained
      a core of deep, ineffable black.
    </p>

    <p>
      In its throne, the Elder sat forward with its back curved to an extreme
      degree, its long, slender arms spread widely to each side for stability,
      propping up its disproportionately large head. While it was hard to tell
      at this distance, and especially considering the room was designed to
      exaggerate, the Elder seemed about twice as large as any full-grown man,
      though its humanoid proportions were all its own. It shared some of the
      same features of the demon that led the Speaker below, with a few
      pronounced differences.
    </p>

    <p>
      While its ears curled upwards and inwards, they were degrees larger in
      size, accounting for a large portion of the head’s profile, and had stiff
      outcroppings like the branches of a tree or the antlers of an elk – as the
      branches grew, they seemed to weave between each other and end in points
      that dug into various parts of the Elder’s flesh, some even penetrating
      other branches, causing a viscous, red substance to flow down its head.
      Its complexion looked just as diseased – wrinkled, blemished and covered
      in deep rot.
    </p>

    <p>
      It’s face, however, was obscured by an extravagant stone-gray mask,
      engraved on its border with the type of shifting, inscrutable demonscript
      he was accustomed to from the long nights reading countless dusty tomes.
      The center of the mask, however, would continuously morph in what seemed
      to be an attempt to recreate facial expressions humans could understand to
      go with with its speech. He assumed the Elder’s real face would have no
      mechanism to emulate such a human feature. The result, however, was deeply
      unsettling and ambiguous.
    </p>

    <p>
      At times, it formed sunken eyes, bright points darting between all of
      those arrayed before it in turn, with a vaguely elliptical object for the
      mouth full of innumerable fanged protrusions, pushing forwards and back,
      switching places to reveal all new sets of hooked and vicious dentata.
      What expression that could mean was anybody’s guess. Sometimes, the eyes
      would droop to the sides and disappear as the jagged elliptical mouth grew
      to overtake the entire face, becoming a swirling mass of countless
      gnashing fangs. It seemed quite threatening. Still other times, the
      features would wash away to reveal almost nothing, only the hints of holes
      for eyes. But it was always changing, especially as it spoke.
    </p>

    <p>
      Its voice came in rumbling waves that seemed to swaddle him in coarse,
      unyielding blankets of stone, reverberating in such low notes that it was
      difficult to perceive which direction the voice was coming from – it felt
      like it was coming from all around you. Despite the depth of its voice, it
      was framed by a distinct hissing, a raspiness that pierced the ear, making
      it almost painful to hear.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span className="small-caps">
        The time to fufill yourselves has come. The last speaker to question the
        Omni Mutatio was given the honor of its intimiate experience.
      </span>
      &nbsp;The mask fanned multiple serrated points outwards, making it look much
      bigger.
    </p>

    <p>
      A small, slender person in front, obscured by their cloak, responded with
      a soprano voice that seemed to be both soft and strong. It had a breathy
      effortlessness, though when she spoke, it seemed to resonate as it carried
      on the stone. He recognized it.
    </p>

    <p>
      “As I guide the city towards the tribute, I must ensure it remains virile
      and strong. I wish to contribute <em>more</em>, in ways that go beyond our
      time in the Depths. I do not question the authority of the Domitorem in
      any way. But by knowing its purpose, we can serve the cause the rest of
      the year, as well.”
    </p>

    <p>
      She was the third in line to the Elder, the Lady Tyrant of the Tribute, or
      the Black Madonna, as she was known to the average cornmonger. Her family
      had been stewards of the effort to build the effigy at the city’s center
      for as far back as history went, and she lead the transition from the main
      idol of the Domitorem to the pillar that would reach into the cosmos.
      Despite her title of Tyrant, she had a reputation among the commonfolk of
      being fair, even-handed and just. Others said she was utterly ruthless and
      performed sickening experiments on those who worked for her. He simply
      assumed her heritage came with some sort of detachment from reality.
    </p>

    <p>
      “This is ridiculous,” joined a large, portly man behind her. “We serve the
      Domitorem unconditionally and without question. His guidance is our light.
      Every moment of the blood sky is our divine right, our Rebirth,” he said,
      growing louder and straining his face, one hand pounding the wooden table
      before him with every emphasis. “Without our service, we have nothing – we 
      <em>are</em> nothing. Do you presume you could <em>comprehend</em> the
      motives of the Domitorem? The arrogance is galling even for you, Lady{" "}
      <em>Tyrant</em>,” he said with a venomous emphasis on her title, which was
      met with a chorus of muttering around him and some heads nodding fiercely.
    </p>

    <p>
      “It doesn’t surprise me to hear this from the Speaker of the Apothecary,”
      joined another, a pale-skinned man with a gaunt, sallow face. He stood out
      from the sea of tepid brown as the only person whose garment was a deep
      shade of red. He had a half-smile that made him seem to relish the words
      that came next. “You have always been spared the Depths as long as you
      provide your poisons and blood magicks. Your family hasn’t served once for
      generations.” The room erupted with talk before a strong voice overpowered
      it.
    </p>

    <p>
      “How dare you, Cazio? Lareth’s honor is unassailable, and his family has
      served the Domitorem for generations. His venerated status was earned. And
      what about your failures to control the Redcloaks? Your lot seems more
      interested in roaming the gutters looking for cast-offs and ferals than it
      is contributing to our great work.” A deeper, contralto voiced woman sat
      upright with shoulders angled directly at Cazio, the red-cloaked man. Her
      eyes were large and fierce, and they flickered as she spoke like firelight
      on the edge of a blade. A symbol like a star with infinite rays over a
      black moon was embossed on her tunic and cloak. The sigil of the Guild of
      the Caretakers of Law.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cazio sat unmoved, staring at the woman with the same half-smile on his
      face.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Look, I make no argument that our service in the Depths is not the
      honorable work,” the Black Madonna interjected. “Your point is well
      marked, Talis and Lareth. What I ask for is simply knowledge, so that we
      may be empowered to contribute more. The knowledge I seek would only aid
      the Domitorem in our knowing. We have fought for centuries, beseeched by
      the Domitorem in the darkest time of our species, where we knew nothing
      but blood and stone. We sat like children in the dark, wandering the
      harshest wasteland, where we can no longer survive. He came to us to raise
      us into service – our transformation paying for the Epiphany. It is a
      great price to humanity that we gladly pay. How can I deny that we would
      be completely lost without the Epiphany? Had we been robbed of it, the
      grand city of First Child, twenty million people working in unison to form
      the greatest Tribute our kind has ever known, would be lost to the void.”
    </p>

    <p>
      He noticed that she was now standing up, though he didn’t remember exactly
      when that had happened. Her location in the front had served her, facing
      the entire Speaker’s Order with her back to the Elder, engaging them all
      as she spoke. She knew her audience. They sat in silence, easily cowed by
      the power of her speech. She stood straight, her chin pointed only
      slightly above a perpendicular plane to those who watched her, and looked
      them all in the eye in turn. Her long, jet black hair came through the
      folds of her cloak, as if it was slowly consuming her.
    </p>

    <p>
      “But we must also acknowledge the cost of our yearly transformation. The
      things that we have suffered, the things we’ve done against our will – it
      has left us overrun with the sick. Not just sick in body, but sick in
      mind. Suicides are a daily occurrence. No one sleeps. Every form of vice
      is practiced to the extreme, but none feel pleasure. There are so many
      sects that they are beyond number – and the rites and ceremonies that they
      perform can become so extreme in their attempts to weaken the influence of
      the Depths – many believe that by performing certain acts, they will be
      spared the worst tasks while transformed. The streets are littered with
      refuse and the dead and dying. Those who do not kill themselves or starve,
      eventually lose their minds. They become ‘feral’ and prey on us in the
      dark. And there are even some, we know, that have peered too far into the
      Depths and seek to recreate the horror that they find there. We find
      people missing in the night, never to be seen again.
    </p>

    <p>
      “But beyond that. I remember visions from my time in the depths as clear
      as if they were happening right now. The horrors we endure there are
      beyond comprehension. If we weren’t spared the full accounting of our time
      in the depths because of the mixture of senses, this city – our great
      Tribute – would be dust,” she said. She began speaking louder and quicker
      to cover the murmurings that began to rise.
    </p>

    <p>
      “How am I to build our Tribute if we do not have people to build it? Ever
      year, there are fewer workers. We can turn the city to corpses without
      scratching the surface of the Tribute’s destined height and power. Some of
      you have never made the sacrifice. There are good reasons we keep the
      Speakers lucid and human at all times. But I tell you from a purely
      practical stance: we cannot sustain this. We are in decline. If we do not
      do something, we will die.”
    </p>

    <p>
      The room burst into activity, many speakers jumping out of their seats
      with harshly contracted faces, pointing and waving aggressively at the
      Black Madonna, while others pulled at their cloaks, yelling their own
      grievances at the other speakers. The Initiate remained seated, glancing
      at the Elder who sat frozen, its mask mostly blank save for a small symbol
      of a triangle with three overlapping concentric circles directly in the
      center. The fires beside it flickered gently.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Black Madonna stood unaffected at the head of the room, slowly
      scanning the chaotic mass of speakers. When she got to him, she stopped
      for the briefest of moments, and he could feel her eyes pierce him to the
      core. Her face seemed to flash at him, as if it was a mirror that caught
      the light just so, and her face illuminated as she looked him in the eye.
    </p>

    <p>
      A low grumbling and murmuring rose until it became almost deafening, when
      he realized the Elder was preparing to speak. He looked up and saw the
      flames beside the demon now contracting intensely.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span className="small-caps">
        If there is a failure to manage the city, it is yours. I would expect
        this from the Redcloaks, but not from you.
      </span>
      &nbsp;The Elder’s mask blossomed with teeth and eyes that stretched in random
      directions to cover every part of its surface. Its exquisite antlers
      trembled as it spoke, sending black crimson trails pulsing down the side
      of its body.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span className="small-caps">
        We provide bountiful resources. We bring light where there is darkness.
        We ask–
      </span>
      &nbsp;it held up one atrophied crooked limb with a single digit extended from it
      like a crooked nose <span className="small-caps">–but one price.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      The room was deathly silent. The loud arguing ceased immediately on the
      word of the demon sitting far above. Those who were standing remained so,
      waiting for the Elder to finish.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span className="small-caps">
        I am interested why you pursue this. Let us speek freely. Those who feel
        the Lady Tyrant's words served us, speak now.
      </span>
      &nbsp;The mask’s cluster of teeth had been replaced with a thin line surrounded
      by small flaps. It’s eyes shrank and became round, black pits.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cazio, the smirking man in the red cloak, stood immediately, raising a
      confident fist into the air.
    </p>

    <p>
      “They serve us, Elder. I have seen the ravages in the margins of the city.
      We Redcloaks do what we can, but we are few. She speaks true.” He glanced
      at the Black Madonna, who gave him a curt nod.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another speaker rose from the back corner, a tall, hunched man who easily
      stood above the others. On his chest, he saw the symbol of two ravens
      facing opposite directions. The Guild of the Eyes of Dust. His voice had
      the texture of depthgate metal – harsh and twisted.
    </p>

    <p>
      “We have spent many years peering into the realm of the Domitorem,
      absorbing its truth. In our learnings, we have seen the necessity of
      cycles, and the feeding of cycles so that they can continue. We see the
      wisdom in the words of the Lady Tyrant.” The man bowed low as he finished
      speaking, bringing the arch of his back level with those arrayed around
      him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next the Cornmonger’s Guild, the Menders Guild, and the Guild of Silent
      Stars. As he watched the Speakers show their support, he noted how many
      sat with looks of contempt and disdain, grasping their cloaks tightly
      around them. Lareth, the Speaker of the Apothecary Guild, had his face
      contorted so tightly that it looked painful. His brows were brought low
      over his eyes, and his mouth curled tightly backwards. Talis, of the
      Caretakers of Law, sat emotionless but tall and confident.
    </p>

    <p>After a silence, the Elder spoke.</p>

    <p>
      <span className="small-caps">
        Honesty is rewarded by the generosity of the Domitorem. Your pleas have
        been noted. What cannot be ignored, however, are questions to our will.
        It is foul insubordination. Those who showed support are spared, but the
        Lady Tyrant will be taken, and punishment meted out as according to the
        will of the almighty Domitorem. Sanctum silentium.
      </span>
    </p>

    <p>
      As it finished, the Black Madonna walked forward into the center of the
      room, steady and calm, betraying no sign of surprise. The Elder’s face
      grew long eyes drooping in a way he could almost interpret as sadness or
      mockery if it weren’t for the clenching fangs below.
    </p>

    <p>
      From the darkness of the far side of the room, he heard a rumble mixed
      with scraping on stone. From the distance in sound, he realized the
      darkness hid a room far grander in size than he first perceived. For how
      long that darkness reached, he could not guess. After listening for what
      seemed like minutes, a dozen demons larger than even the Speaker of the
      Eyes of Dust stepped into the light. They had large, gnashing faces whose
      eyes were clearly gouged out and bleeding; thick trunks for arms that
      featured claws the size of his head; and hulking bellies with demonic
      symbols carved in the flesh, pulsating with each step.
    </p>

    <p>
      They surrounded the Black Madonna and escorted her towards the darkness.
      She walked with her hood up, head facing down, at a slow and deliberate
      pace. The Elder waited until the sound of scraping claws was faint before
      speaking again.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span className="small-caps">
        We have concluded this discussion. There are other matters. We must
        perform the final rite on the initiate and accept him into the Speaker's
        order. Please, bring him forth.
      </span>
      &nbsp;The Elder’s masked hid its teeth and revealed four black eyes the size of
      coins.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was time. After his years of study, his years of suffering. He saw the
      life of a Speaker before him. The years of apprenticeship followed by
      years of governorship, leading a Guild and bringing the word of the Elder
      and the Domitorem to the people. No lack for food or shelter. No service
      in the Depths. There was no better life in First Child.
    </p>

    <p>But there was something else he had to do.</p>

    <p>
      The other Speakers watched in solemn silence as he stood and walked
      towards the throne. The Elder rose, it’s long arms extending straight,
      lifting the creature from its perch. It began its otherworldly locomotion
      spinning limbs over limbs, reaching down the side of a pathway that led to
      the floor. As it moved, it revealed a mass of rotten, limp appendages that
      streamed behind it like a river jellyfish. The limbs, unused, were broken
      and neglected, and looked as if they festered uncontrolled.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Initiate took a small, sharp dagger he had hidden in his cloak and
      pressed it slowly against the inside of his wrist. He steeled himself for
      a moment, and pressed as hard as he could, feeling the tip of his blade
      touch bone. He felt the white hot rush of pain, so overwhelming that the
      edges of his vision faded to black. The taste in his mouth grew metallic,
      then dried as if he had eaten a handful of ashes. Symbols on his arm
      subtly glowed deep purple, indicating it had worked.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first part was done. The Elder was past the halfway mark, pulling
      itself around the final curve of the stone down to the ground, where it
      would approach him to perform the rite.
    </p>

    <p>
      He put the dagger back in the small pouch he had sewn on the inside of his
      sleeve, and took the other instrument he had hidden – a pair of pliers. He
      held them under his robe as close to his mouth as he could get, and
      waited.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Elder pulled itself next to him, and it was then he noticed the smell.
      It was unlike anything he had ever experienced. To say it smelled of death
      would be simplistic. It smelled as if a thousand bodies had been left to
      rot in the sun for months, and then drowned in the most putrid sewer water
      he could imagine. It hit him so hard he almost threw the pliers into his
      nose in a reflexive attempt to stop it entering his nose. He resisted,
      barely.
    </p>

    <p>
      It pulled itself above him, coiling in its many limbs, its masked face
      staring down at him and revealing a complex lattice-work of teeth and
      symbols. The mask changed so rapidly, he thought he could see patterns in
      the motion, like reflections of the moon in rippled water.
    </p>

    <p>This was it.</p>

    <p>
      He opened his cloak, placed the pliers around his two front teeth, and
      pulled hard. He heard two cracks as the teeth came out and felt hot blood
      gushing from the open wounds. He pulled back his sleeve to reveal the deep
      knife cut in his arm, and jammed the two teeth into it as hard as he
      could.
    </p>

    <p>
      All he could see was fire – a seething hot blaze that singed his beard,
      eyebrows and hair, burning his face as it gushed all around him,
      projecting a noise so loud his skull began to vibrate. Through the
      blinding light of the fire, he saw the Elder’s stone mask disintegrate,
      revealing a vile mass of countless eyes over a mouth lined by meter long,
      bloody protrusions that looked like elk horn without its velvet. It slowly
      peeled away to reveal the corrupt fibers underneath, until its whole body
      seemed to burn away completely.
    </p>

    <p>When the fire ended, his vision turned to black.</p>

    <p>
      He did not dream, but he was lucid. There was nothing. Whether he lie dead
      or alive, whether it was his mind or some other horrible dimension, he did
      not know. Without a point of reference, he lost all concept of time. For
      how long he remained in this state, he could not say.
    </p>

    <p>
      He began to feel something. Not much at first, just a vague sense of
      dryness in his face. Then he felt a coldness in his arms and his legs,
      lying limp on a flat surface, followed by the slow rising and falling of
      his chest. Once he felt his breathing, the pain hit him. It was
      excruciating. He realized the dryness of his face was actually intense
      pain, blooming through his body like being submerged in it. Every moment
      felt as if he was both being burned again and pressed against frigid ice.
      In order to distract him from the pain, he tried opening his eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      At first, he saw nothing but a blurry haze. After moments of burning pain,
      he slowly resolved the outline of a slender woman sitting beside him, a
      small candle lighting her from beneath. She had black hair that swaddled
      her, almost consuming her. Regaining some piece of who he was, he
      recognized her as the Black Madonna.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Don’t move. You will take long to heal, and even longer if you’re
      stubborn,” she said, spreading a light, semi-transparent blanket over him
      that soothed his pain immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      He tried to form words in his mouth, and it first, nothing seemed to come
      out but dust and a dry wheeze. Eventually, he generated enough saliva to
      form words in his throat.
    </p>

    <p>“Did I kill it?” he said.</p>

    <p>
      She sat back down. “Yes and no. Elders don’t die as such. It will come
      back. But it will be diminished. It is no small feat to destroy the body
      of an Elder,” she said, pressing the blanket against his forehead, giving
      him precious relief from the pain.
    </p>

    <p>
      “I did not think I would survive,” he said, the words coming easier now.
    </p>

    <p>
      “There’s no guarantee you would have. But you did. We chose rightly in
      you.”
    </p>

    <p>“Won’t the Domitorem transform us and destroy us? Aren’t we doomed?”</p>

    <p>
      She lifted her hand and looked at him. While it was hard to tell through
      the blanket and the dim candlelight, he thought she was smiling.
    </p>

    <p>
      “We have ways to prevent the transformation. They are secrets passed down
      to us for generations. The Domitorem cannot find us here.” She began
      pressing against his forehead again. “We seek to overthrow the Domitorem
      and free ourselves forever.”
    </p>

    <p>
      It finally made sense. The mysterious visitor. The offer of vengeance. To
      hurt a demon for once. Oh God, the horrors we endure. I had to do
      something, <em>anything</em>, even if it meant I died – especially if it
      meant I died.
    </p>

    <p>He didn’t realize anyone could actually fight them.</p>

    <p>“Where do I sign up?”</p>

    <p>
      She appeared to smile again. “Ah, see, that’s why I’m here. As I said,
      killing an Elder is no small feat. We have some things we would like you
      to do. If you help us, you will be part of our family and learn the
      secrets we keep in our struggle against the Domitorem. What do you say? Do you want it?”
    </p>

    <p>
      He waited a moment, not to take anytime deciding, but for added gravity in
      his answer.
    </p>

    <p>“More than I’ve wanted anything in my life.”</p>

    <p>
      She gave his head a final pat and rose, leaving the candle at his bedside
      . Before walking into the darkness, she looked down at him.
    </p>

    <p>“Welcome to the resistance.”</p>
