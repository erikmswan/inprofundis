    <p>He watched his brother hang by his feet.</p>
    <p>
      Surrounding him, making grotesque movements in a coordinated dance, were
      creatures the Initiate did not recognize. They stood taller than the
      average person at just over five and a half feet, though if they unarched
      their backs, they would have been taller. Their heads hung forward, eyes
      sunken and red, their noseless faces ornamented only by their exaggerated,
      ill-fitting teeth that punctured their lips as they chattered. Their flesh
      sagged and constricted as if made for a creature of different proportions.
      They reminded him of what we became in the yearly Transformation, though
      he knew these were not humans, but the creatures from the Domitorem's
      realm.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they moved beside his brother, they dug their jagged claws wherever
      they could find purchase. Blood poured in thick streams down his inverted
      cloak, which dusted the ground. In normal circumstances, his injuries
      would have been fatal long ago, but forces he did not understand kept him
      alive. The ritual was not over.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood with the other initiates in front of the stage, just behind the
      Speakers he would soon join. Behind him stood the assembled citizenry of
      the city of First Child, numbering in the tens of thousands, and gathered
      to witness the justice of the Domitorem. Some clustered in the auburn
      caravans of the Gephsit, where floating runes burned around their shadowed
      carriages, and a hazy purple mist evaporated above them, the run-off of
      the altered atmosphere they breathed wherever they went. He saw the grand,
      regimented tents covered in meticulously detailed depictions of the
      heavens and pitched by the Guild of the Silent Stars, the erudite
      astronomers who could see the future. They knelt in rows beside their
      camp, waving green torches and muttering hymns. Others he saw poking out
      the windows of the few ruined buildings that still littered the path
      around the great amphitheatre, some swarmed by the orphan gangs known as
      “grubbies” that vied for territory in the margins of the city. But most
      stood in scattered groups across the ruined field, wrapped in frayed
      cloaks that spanned entire families, small eyes peeking through the folds
      to see the spectacle before them. They watched with the solemn
      understanding of his brother’s crime. As a full-fledged Speaker, his
      brother must have understood more than most.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Initiate’s face held like stone, and he stood upright. There would be
      eyes watching him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above him, the Elder stood – if one could use such a term – atop a twisting,
      blackened platform, towering over the cobbled stone of the stage, and
      obscured by crimson drapery. As the official governor-designate of the
      city of First Child, the Elder officiated punishment rituals, especially
      ones as grave as this. Citizens, however, were forbidden to see him. Only
      the Speakers – and initiates about to become a Speaker – were permitted to
      see behind the veil. The silhouettes projected onto the shroud left him no
      curiosity. It would happen soon enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its voice came in rumbling waves that seemed to swaddle him in unyielding
      blankets of stone, reverberating in such low notes that it was difficult
      to perceive which direction the voice was coming from. Despite its depth,
      it was framed by a distinct raspiness that made it painful to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="small-caps">
        Citizens of First Child, you have gathered to witness the justice of the
        Domitorem. This Speaker has betrayed us all beyond any true reckoning,
        but we must serve what punishment we can. He has been convicted of
        treason of the highest order. He worked in secret to undermine the glory
        of the Omni Mutatio, your divine service to the Domitorem. We will not
        suffer a betrayer. The Domitorem speaks, and his words flow through me.
        Witness his justice.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Initiate held firm. His observers would not see him betray any
      emotion, shed any tear, flinch at any word. A traitor deserved their
      punishment. They must be punished. The words echoed in his mind. He would
      not fail like his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, deep within, he felt the thought cling, determined to remain,
      unextinguishable despite his years of conditioning. His brother had been
      in his final year of service, after which he would have a lifetime of
      comfort. Every citizen served, and through that service came the
      Domitorem’s reward. After the tenth year, citizens were provided a house
      with servants, a monthly stipend, and, most importantly, were spared the
      yearly Transformation, what the Elder called the Omni Mutatio, or what
      citizens called the Inversion, or the Ripskin, or the Rebirth – there were
      endless names for it. All one had to do was survive.
    </p>
    <p>
      His brother had been so close. Why would he throw it away? Why would he
      subvert the will of the Domitorem, when he had spent his life in his
      service? If nothing else, his stupidity warranted the punishment. The
      Initiate had followed in his brother’s footsteps, suffering the cruel
      rituals, learning the countless dictums and edicts of the Domitorem; and
      giving his mind, body and soul to becoming a Speaker. And now, his brother
      hung before him, forever marked a traitor. He knew the righteousness of
      what he saw.
    </p>
    <p>And yet.</p>
    <p>
      Crashing thunder snapped him to attention. The ritual was reaching its
      climax.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="small-caps">
        We offer this tribute to the coming Blood Sky, the herald of our
        service. We strike this man from our history. His name will never again
        be spoken in the great halls of First Child. His deeds will be forgotten
        – all save one. This one moment will be his legacy. From the ashes of
        betrayal will our dominion be reaffirmed.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      On the final word, the demons on the stage ceased their dancing and lunged
      at his brother, their fangs bared, their claws extended twice the size he
      thought them capable. They ripped and shredded, a fleshly geyser until all
      that remained was a mound lying scattered across the stage, so
      unrecognizable as his brother that for a moment, he felt his brother's
      suffering had ended, until a demon emerged, holding his head high for all
      to see, his mouth bobbing open and closed like a fish, as if he still
      breathed.
    </p>
    <Divider />
    <p>
      As the Initiate walked down the black-cobbled street, he marked the faces
      of the people, pallid and glacial, as they carried about the business of
      the open-air market. Some sold fetid corpses that looked like imps, hung
      on racks as meat for cooking. Others offered ancient trinkets they claimed
      would protect you from the worst of the Transformation, though he knew
      they were just old sheep bones. Most, he knew, were preparing for their
      time in the Depths, the other realm they went when fully transformed. It
      was expected a week from now, and the mood of the market was somber,
      haunted by the ritual dirges played by broken men and women along the
      darkened alleys, and punctuated only by the quiet haggling of
      market-goers. They, like him, were detached.
    </p>
    <p>
      He noticed it first in the puddles of black muck that lay beside the
      pathway. Slowly, it’s hue shifted from the white of a noonday sun, the
      color growing warmer and more saturated, until it was unmistakable. A
      crimson red bloomed.
    </p>
    <p>The Blood Sky had arrived a week early.</p>
    <p>
      He saw others in the street market caught mid-trade, one pair still
      grasping the same red, jagged dart that served as currency in this
      district, catatonic while they beheld the sky. The Initiate wondered what
      was going through their minds as they prepared for what came next, whether
      they felt a morbid pride in their duty, or simple terror at transforming
      into our other creatures and heading into the Depths for a week of
      receiving and inflicting torturous pain.
    </p>
    <p>The market erupted into activity as the people fled.</p>
    <p>
      He pulled his ill-fitting, ragged cloak tighter around him as he turned
      around. The arrival of the Blood Sky meant the council of Speakers would
      be meeting, and his initiation was at hand. He did not have long.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled a black phial from his cloak, uncorking it and hastily drinking
      its contents. Black stains framed his mouth, remnants of the foul drug
      that all initiates consumed as preparation for their last rites into the
      Speaker’s Order. Its numbing effect caused his mouth to droop to one side,
      exposing a corner of his yellow teeth and giving his face an expression of
      boredom or contempt.
    </p>
    <Divider />
    <p>
      As a Speaker, he would be protected for the first time in his life. Four
      long years of isolation, daily self-flagellation, sacrifices of blood and
      constant study of history, philosophy and theology.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final trial, where he consumed the fluids of the city’s innermost
      river, had left a permanent mark. Prepared for decades by the
      apothecaries, the river’s water caused vision to grow sharper, his hairs
      to stand on end, and his attention to snap from object to object like a
      malnourished bird. It kept him awake and left his body aching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speakers were spared the yearly Transformation. Instead, he and the other
      Speakers would communicate with the demon clergy, known as Elders, who
      received divine command from the Domitorem itself, the eternal master of
      First Child, and all else that was known and unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the contract his people made at the beginning of history: the
      Domitorem and its demons from the other realms provide resources,
      revelation, purpose and protection, and in exchange, the people of the
      city of First Child serve their tours in the Depths. Only a small group of
      “Speakers” would be kept lucid at all times to ensure the will of the
      Domitorem was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      As much as he tried to suppress it, he was overwhelmed with a feeling of
      relief. Every citizen besides a Speaker had to serve. Of course, it was an
      open secret that some privileged people who made secret deals with the
      Elders, providing them all manner of horrors to serve their clandestine
      goals, were given special protections and spared their tours in the
      Depths. He was not so fortunate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being 16, he had only served four times, as all citizens of the city must
      serve once they reach the age of 12. The memories were tricky, as the
      transformation changed everything about the sense, but what little he
      remembered haunted him every night. His consciousness would go from
      receiving one type of input – smells, sights, sounds – to… combinations of
      them, layered with sensations he had never experienced. He could feel
      every piece of the air around him as if it were made of particles gently
      swaying, then jostled around as objects moved about in space. Rays would
      form in oblong patterns before him, not in any way he could see, but in
      ways that he interpreted as a type of distance-measuring sense. And beyond
      the difference in type of sense, it also overwhelmed in sheer volume. His
      mind was hammered with alien sensations.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the senses resolved, and his overstressed mind had a moment of
      lucidity, he could see the fringes of what he supposed were the tasks set
      before him in the labyrinthine Depths.
    </p>
    <p>It was suffering and pain.</p>
    <p>
      He remembered being cut open from top to bottom, down his limbs, across
      his scalp, and opened, his skin peeled back to reveal blood-slick muscle
      beneath – then singed on every nerve with instruments tipped with
      white-hot fires wielded by unrecognizable creatures, their faces a
      swirling mass of flesh, small tendrils pulling it from within, while a
      viscous, radiant liquid streamed down in waves. His organs were sliced
      open and pulled apart, then reconstituted and inserted back in. And he
      would feel it all, regardless of how deconstructed he became.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if he wasn’t being tortured, he was the one torturing. Even worse, in
      the form of the demon he became, he wanted to. His cruelty meant he would
      not suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one knew the exact location of the Depths, though many assumed it
      resided somewhere between the Domitorem’s realm and our own. And despite
      much speculation about the mechanics of the transformation and its
      purpose, there was little conclusive fact. Some believed that the citizens
      of First Child helped fight a war against the Domitorem’s enemies, perhaps
      to bring the same revelation and purpose it brought us. Others claim they
      served as subjects for the learnings of the Domitorem, so that it may find
      greater truths about the fabrics of reality. Still others claimed there is
      no purpose at all, and that the Depths were a realm of pure chaos.
      Regardless of the truth, the Elders have never revealed what the
      transformation is and what purpose it serves in the Depths.

    <p>
      As he emerged from the cluster of buildings that bordered the street
      market, the statue known as the Tribute at the city’s center was framed
      perfectly. In the dreary red haze, four of its jagged, burnt red
      appendages thrust outwards in aggressive angles, forming the base of a
      tower that would ultimately rise above the clouds. The body of the tower
      depicted the Domitorem itself, and although no human had ever communicated
      with the Domitorem directly, its image was everywhere in the city and
      ingrained in the minds of the people of First Child.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not realized he had fallen into a reverie until a voice, smooth and
      resonant, called him from behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Initiate,” it said, “I would have a word with you before you continue.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to see a woman standing in the darkness of an alley off the
      street. As his eyes resolved the billowing silhouette, a jolt went through
      his body, putting his hairs on end. Her long, dark hair, obscuring her
      torso, ruffled softly as the wind swept it. She wore a flowing robe
      adorned with golden webs of thread, glowing softly against the darkness,
      marking her years of religious scholarship at the highest levels of the
      Speaker’s Order. Her face was hard and serious. As he gathered his senses,
      he knew who he saw, and it flooded his mouth with the coppery taste of
      fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was the third in line to the Elder, known as Speaker Moltus, the Lady
      Tyrant of the Tribute, or the Black Madonna, as she was known to the
      average cornmonger. Her family had been stewards of the effort to build
      the effigy at the city’s center for as far back as history went, and she
      lead the transition from the main idol of the Domitorem to the pillar that
      would reach into the cosmos. Despite her title of Tyrant, she had a
      reputation among the commonfolk of being fair, even-handed and just.
      Others said she was utterly ruthless and performed sickening experiments
      on those who worked for her. What could she possibly want from him?
    </p>
    <p>As he stood watching her, she addressed him again.</p>
    <p>
      “Boy, answer my questions, and I will release you. Do you know who I am?”
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice started weak but gained strength as he spoke. “Yes, Speaker
      Moltus. I will answer any questions you have.”
    </p>
    <p>“You are to be initiated as a full-fledged speaker today, yes?”</p>
    <p>“Yes, Speaker Moltus.”</p>
    <p>
      She stepped forward out of the darkness, her hair flowing behind her as
      she moved, stopping close enough to require her to look down at him.
    </p>
    <p>“Give me your hand, boy.”</p>
    <p>
      He pulled back his cloak to reveal a thin, tattooed forearm. A hand burst
      from her robe and grabbed him, holding firmly and pulling him towards her.
      Her grip was freezing. The initiate watched her as she examined his arm,
      turning it over and studying his wrist and hand. He could only guess what
      she was looking for. Various markings of the flesh are used to invoke
      forbidden types of power, which he had seen on corpses throughout the
      city. Perhaps she looked for markings such as those. Or perhaps she was
      looking to make her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dropped his arm and looked up at him, eyes black and hard. “I know of
      the treachery your brother committed. The Domitorem now looks at all his
      kin with suspicion. Your name is sullied, so your loyalty must be proven.
      Do you seek to prove that loyalty?” Her expression did not change, save at
      the end, when he realized she had only just begun to look directly in his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt a bead of sweat form at his temple. Hadn’t he proved it enough? He
      had given no one a reason to doubt his loyalty. Even when his cohort kept
      their distance, when they eyed him suspiciously and whispered to each
      other when they thought he couldn’t hear them, he had kept his composure
      and pressed on. He performed the rites, he said the words, he bled just as
      they did. Surely, no one doubted him still? He hardened his face and
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I seek to prove it, Speaker Moltus, and I will prove it every day if the
      Domitorem requires. I have nothing to hide. My brother was a traitor and
      deserved his fate. Justice was done that day. I abide.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Air blew from her nostrils. “Good words, initiate. Good words. Listen to
      the voice inside you. Let it speak through your body. A true speaker
      speaks in all languages at once. And it is our own voice we must hear. Do
      you understand?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Initiate hesitated. “I… I understand that words must be carefully
      chosen. We must be true to our intent.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost imperceptibly, she nodded. “We must be true to our intent, yes.
      Carefully chosen, yes. But what is true in one language is a lie in
      another. When mixing domains, we get the unexpected.” She paused, as if
      waiting for him to respond.
    </p>
    <p>“Yes, Speaker.”</p>
    <p>“Do you see the Tribute at the center of the city?”</p>
    <p>“Yes, Speaker.”</p>
    <p>“Describe what you see.”</p>
    <p>
      The margins of the Domitorem were the first thing his mind comprehended.
      “It has sharp protrusions running along its perimeter that are stuck in
      webs. The webs wrap a mass in the center that spills through in trails
      down its side and into its many legs, surrounding it like a curled
      centipede.” He stopped to look at her, but she was looking at neither him
      nor the tribute. He continued, “It rises upwards, flanked by... runes. At
      the top is what many consider the ‘head,’ though it is obscured by a white
      cover that is tightly pulled. Through the cover, one can see a dozen holes
      near the top, and a single large hole near the bottom. Above the Domitorem
      is a double-helix of bones, collected from sacrifices in the Depths. Only
      the first tier is complete. The second tier has just begun.” He stopped
      again to look at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She paced slowly along the street, contemplating something. Though he
      heard the bustle of the city only moments before, he was painfully aware
      of the silence that lay over them, a stuffiness and closeness that
      unnerved him. The sky had fallen a deep shade of crimson, and the light
      thickened the air with menace. Buildings that were gray, blue, green or
      white were all now just red. She stopped and turned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As good a description as any. But you see only the surface. Look beneath.
      They will look beneath your surface, easily. You must make sure your depth
      is so vast that their vision cannot reach you. Do not fail this test,
      young initiate. There is only one outcome that saves you from the
      Domitorem’s wrath. Remember my words. Speak all languages at once. If you
      understand me, you will be protected. Hurry, now. The Council begins.”
    </p>
    <p>
      With that, she walked back into the alley, passing beyond sight in the
      pitch black. He stood there, peering into the darkness, imagining he could
      see her still. After a moment, he rubbed his hood against his temple,
      wiping away the sweat. He would have to control his body better if he
      wished to survive the initiation.
    </p>
    <Divider />
    <p>
      He emerged onto the long path that followed the river Kultata, which would
      take him directly to his destination. There were five rivers in the city
      of First Child, each forming a perfect circle around the city center in
      progressive rings. They were natural lines in the hierarchy between
      various guilds that governed each district of the city, the ones closer to
      the center, of course, being more important and influential. The river
      Kultata was the second from the city center and bordered the Apothecary
      Guild district on its outer side, where he now walked. The river had a
      luster like oil, being a solid, jet black, but glowed as it reflected the
      sun, refracting the light to give it’s own purples, greens and yellows. It
      flowed with a substance less viscous and more dense than water, which
      meant it was impossible to swim in. However you flailed or struggled –
      regardless of how well you swam in water – if you fell into the river, you
      were sucked under, your arms and legs unable to push yourself in a liquid
      so weak. He never walked too close to the edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the city walls was a wasteland. Attempts in ancient times to settle
      outside the city met with universal failure. If it wasn’t the dead soil,
      the constant storms or the all-encompassing fog, it was vicious predators
      perfectly adapted to the harshness of the environment and scouring every
      corner of the badlands. Instead, small pockets of agriculture existed
      within the city, especially among the Cornmongers Guild, supplemented by
      food provided by the Elder’s demon servants. From where they got the food,
      he didn’t know and didn’t want to. Still, the average citizen of First
      Child went hungry most days.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked beside the river until the light began to fade and the path
      became more narrow, signaling that he was getting close to the edge of the
      Apothecary Guild district, where the Elder resided. When he looked up at
      the houses along the path, he could see the changes happening to the
      people already – those who watched the sky grew longer, scaly features;
      their eyes grew wide and vicious; their arms and legs wilted like they
      were left in the sun to rot, leaving only gnarled limbs like tree branches
      tipped with claws; their skin was scabbed and soaked with pus that ran
      from sickly brown boils. Their gazes, he could feel, moved gradually from
      the sky and onto him, the pits of their eyes shining in the background of
      pitch. They would soon be leaving their houses to join the others heading
      for the Depths. He turned his eyes towards the ornate, looming building of
      the Elder, which could be seen from miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The transformed others started to fill the paths, waiting in line to enter
      one of the many activated gates that dotted the public spaces across the
      city. He had never seen them active before. They were twisted, pockmarked
      horseshoes made of rusted iron, but in their dormant state showed a vision
      of what was already there. Walking through one would do nothing – not that
      anyone would ever try. People kept as much distance as they could from the
      metal gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that the gate was active, the center was perfectly dark. Red tendrils
      reached from inside to grip the edges, pulsing and straining as if losing
      the edges would close it. Other tendrils wrapped the citizens as they
      entered the gate to pull them into the Depths. He saw the transformed
      citizens mauling each other as they stood in line, using their massive
      claws to rake the backs of the creatures in front, mouths open and fangs
      bared, tearing flesh. Other demons – servants of the Domitorem – carried
      long stakes made out of what looked like charcoal that they used to stop
      fights between the citizens, stabbing them apart before they did too much
      damage to each other. They didn’t get them all, however, as some of the
      citizens ripped each other apart too quickly, clawing into each other’s
      bellies and eating them from the inside, piles of gore developing on the
      edges of the crowd like the froth of a low tide.
    </p>
    <p>
      The demons policing the line looked similar to the transformed citizens,
      having the same wilted, lanky appendages; flaky, blemished skin and giant
      heads, their mouths filled with inch-long fangs that were always visible.
      Their ears were each the size of their already freakishly large heads,
      giving him the impression of a provoked cobra about to strike.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt a drop on his exposed hand, then another. A rain began, escalating
      quickly from a gentle shower. Red beads splattered on the ground, and the
      clouds darkened as the moisture in the air coalesced into a storm. As the
      water began to pool around bodies of the dead, long, thin strands of blood
      flowed through the channels of the cobblestone street like fresh
      watercolor, the gruesome art of the citizens’ new forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he approached the Elder’s tower, he saw how the extravagant
      architecture served less for shelter and more as a display of dominion and
      unmitigated power over all else. It stood at least triple the height of
      the nearest building, boasting balconies, towers, exposed staircases, and
      outcroppings that brooded directly over its neighbors. While the
      indication of engravings covered every visible surface, the exact details
      seemed to fight the sense, slowly moving and merging as if it knew it was
      being seen. As soon as it looked like one thing, it seemed to subtly shift
      until it looked nothing like that at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walls of twisted vines and thorn obstructed the view of whatever courtyard
      the inhabitants tended, which he followed until he reached a tall metal
      gate. It too had filigree that seemed to shift and undermine the sense,
      with the exception of a large, multi-sided polygon in concentric circles
      placed directly in the middle.
    </p>
    <p>
      A block to the west of the walls, he saw the alley the stranger had told
      him about. He carefully slipped behind an outcropping in the alley and
      found a strip of brown canvas covering a mound. The stranger spoke true.
      He pulled away the canvas to reveal a dagger, about four inches in length,
      and a pair of pincers, which he placed into two pockets sewn into the
      sleeves of his cloak. They hung heavy, so he pulled his arm tight against
      him and held his sleeve from the inside with his hand before turning back
      to his original destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked up to the gates of the leering tower and stood, looking through
      them. The low sun, peering through a gap in the clouds, cast oblique, red
      rays over the edges of the building’s gnarled features, illuminating the
      rain as it fell. He saw no activity within, hearing nothing but the sound
      of falling rain on stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment, he heard a loud click and watched the gate unhinge itself
      and open, drawing itself inward as if the courtyard was inhaling. He
      stepped through and followed the only path to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the streets outside were poorly cobbled, this was much worse. Rock
      jutted in such severe and random directions that it was painful to walk
      on, and the fact they were all colored the same light-sucking pitch made
      it difficult to negotiate his footing. He assumed it was intentional. One
      more way to keep the Speakers in their place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lining the path were multiple “structures” made from the bodies of imps –
      small, angular creatures with razor-sharp claws and two inch fangs. They
      had tufts of mottled fur on the ends of their tails and ears, along with
      patches over the body. They were bent and broken along the path to form
      arcane symbols, as if they formed a ward – or a curse. One symbol formed a
      circumscribed triangle with six imps on end, skewered down the middle on
      curved metal hooks, their limbs stretched, twisted, and clamped to other
      limbs by compressing a black metal instrument that looked like a bed of
      nails pushing through either side. Dried blood caked around the wounds and
      wove downwards in rivulets, long blackened from time. While he had no love
      for the mischievous creatures, who could be found in the dark corners of
      the city in roaming bands, he took no pleasure in seeing them treated with
      such cruelty. He tried not to look at them, though they seemed to bear
      down on him as if feeling his aversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The path itself grew narrower – the arch covering the pathway drawing
      closer and the margins of the path shrinking – until he could even feel
      protrusions from the imp structures raking at his robe, sharp claw-points
      and limbs pulling at the faded cloth so that he began to angle himself
      sideways, the better to slip through.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he approached the door, resting beneath an arch filled with the same
      sinister inscriptions and covered again with the symbol he saw on the
      gate, he lifted his hand to grip the massive metal object hanging from the
      door. It was covered in sharp points in radial patterns that made it
      impossible to wield without pain, and colored with the same indistinct
      darkness as the path that made it difficult to judge the depth and
      position of the door-knocker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he could touch it, the door swung violently open, sending the metal
      object flailing, and landing with a full-bodied thud against its cradle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing directly before him was a pathetic looking creature about half
      his height, its back curved so sharply it looked pained as it angled its
      head up to face him. It looked humanoid – with all of the appropriate
      appendages that one would expect – though that was where the similarities
      ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its ears curled up and inwards like dried flower petals – wrinkled and
      flaky. Its nose protruded far forwards and down, covering the center of
      its lipless mouth, two scaly flaps of skin that terminated against long,
      yellow black teeth that extended from its mouth in myriad directions. Its
      eyes were unsettling in size – large pits with shimmering black globes
      sunken deep into the skull, with small, bright red points that darted from
      his face to his body and back again. Its skin, matching what the citizens
      of the city now had, looked wrinkled and atrophied, alternating between a
      deep brown and a putrid yellow mixture, obscured by scales and inky
      blemishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It curled its lips back in a tight snarl as it spoke to him in raspy,
      broken breaths, making it difficult to understand as its sentences
      faltered. He had heard it said that the creatures from the Elder’s domain
      never spoke as such – its languages were carried on other mediums than air
      – so it looked as unnatural in its mouth as it sounded, its long black
      tongue clicking its teeth as it formed the syllables.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are <em>late</em>,” it said.
    </p>
    <p>“The sky grows red before its time. I am here to–”</p>
    <p>
      “You have no more time than–” it paused to rearrange its tongue in its
      mouth, “–than what the <em>Elder</em> provides.”
    </p>
    <p>“Then I submit myself for judgment.”</p>
    <p>
      “You <em>submit</em> – yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>The Initiate bowed low.</p>
    <p>
      “<em>Come</em> – with <em>me</em>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The creature turned on its heel, grabbing a torch mounted near the door
      and revealing a long, limp tail hanging flatly against its side, a train
      the Initiate dared not step on.
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed the creature into what seemed like utter darkness with oases
      of light in the form of lonely torches, providing the only islands of
      reality in what seemed like an endless nothing. As they parted the
      darkness, strange figures emerged on the edge, just beyond his sight. He
      saw limbs – at least, he thought they were limbs – undulate in and out of
      the illuminated radius, just enough to log the sense, but not defined
      enough to assign it any profile he could recognize. The sheen of eyes
      appeared briefly and left; elongated, black objects swooped in from above
      and darted out again; and strange <em>clack clack</em> noises, similar to
      the sound of teeth of the creature ahead of him, though from elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they had been in a space too large for the light to reach the edges,
      they soon approached a small archway in the wall made of stone. Through
      it, he could see the hint of spiral stairs leading downwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We go – to the <em>council</em> now.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are <em>speaking</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Know</em> – your place,” it said without turning to face him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed the creature downwards past featureless walls, the steps
      narrow and steep, causing the Initiate to hold the wall to ensure he had
      purchase on the next step, partially obscured by their meager source of
      light, and the fact that darkness licked at his back as the creature
      advanced away from him, its tail curling around the spiral like a dead
      vine clinging to the thick base of an oak.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked in silence. As they descended, the Initiate could not mark the
      time. His legs grew weary from the careful shuffle he had adopted so as
      not to fall forwards on his guide or accidentally step on its tail, and
      his hands grew dry and chafed from following the rough surface of the
      stairway wall. But he would walk without complaint until his body failed,
      and he collapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to hear muffled voices – so soft he wasn't sure they weren’t
      figments of the darkness that consumed them – until it echoed in the
      narrow walls around them in a tinny, reverberating din punctuated by a
      louder, deeper voice that resonated in the stone. The voices grew louder
      and louder until he saw a hint of light coming from down below – the exit
      of the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered a room grander in size than he expected underground. It defied
      space. Countless lines of torches followed upwards but soon broke into
      curves inwards, outwards and around. The walls undulated as the lights
      flickered, and he could see only the faintest image of the ceiling, though
      that was enough to know that it was covered in the same shifting, dense
      mass of what seemed shapes and objects he could not conceive of – their
      edges curling in, rays intersecting at impossible angles, and interwoven
      into textures of such complexity and obscured by such a distance that they
      were inscrutable to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked in without the reaction of any before him – for if they noticed
      his entrance, they betrayed no sign of it – when the guide grabbed him by
      the arm, its claws easily covering its circumference and digging
      forcefully into the muscle, and pointed to an empty seat at the edge of
      one of the occupied tables. The Initiate walked quietly to the empty seat
      next to the other speakers. He then saw his guide turn around and walk
      slowly back up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occupants of the room were immersed in debate. On the right, where the
      creature had directed him, were wooden tables where the Speakers sat, low
      to the ground in a semicircle pattern facing the left, the chairs made of
      curving stone in a design he wasn’t entirely sure were meant to
      accommodate a human body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across from him sat the Elder high in an ornate stage – curving, blackened
      stone twisting to form a peak – sitting in a chair who’s back sat tall
      behind it, angled downwards towards the assembled Speakers before him. The
      structure that formed the stage was decorated with the bodies of creatures
      – not simply imps, as was the case in the entrance – but all manner of
      creatures from the Elder’s realm; ghastly visages twisted in what he could
      only imagine was pain, its limbs interlocked with meticulous cruelty to
      form more of the ancient demonscript, most broken or covered in viscera,
      and only partially obscuring the illuminated engravings that seemed to
      depict the very scene he now observed. It culminated in the peak that now
      framed the Elder, which was flanked by two large fires that, while its
      edges looked like the orange and yellow blaze that he knew well, contained
      a core of deep, ineffable black.
    </p>
    <p>
      In its throne, the Elder sat forward with its back curved to an extreme
      degree, its long, slender arms spread widely to each side for stability,
      propping up its disproportionately large head. While it was hard to tell
      at this distance, and especially considering the room was designed to
      exaggerate, the Elder seemed about twice as large as any full-grown man,
      though its humanoid proportions were all its own. It shared some of the
      same features of the demon that led the Speaker below, with a few
      pronounced differences.
    </p>
    <p>
      While its ears curled upwards and inwards, they were degrees larger in
      size, accounting for a large portion of the head’s profile, and had stiff
      outcroppings like the branches of a tree or the antlers of an elk – as the
      branches grew, they seemed to weave between each other and end in points
      that dug into various parts of the Elder’s flesh, some even penetrating
      other branches, causing a viscous, red substance to flow down its head.
      Its complexion looked just as diseased – wrinkled, blemished and covered
      in deep rot.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s face, however, was obscured by an extravagant stone-gray mask,
      engraved on its border with the type of shifting, inscrutable demonscript
      he was accustomed to from the long nights reading countless dusty tomes.
      The center of the mask, however, would continuously morph in what seemed
      to be an attempt to recreate facial expressions humans could understand to
      go with with its speech. He assumed the Elder’s real face would have no
      mechanism to emulate such a human feature. The result, however, was deeply
      unsettling and ambiguous.
    </p>
    <p>
      At times, it formed sunken eyes, bright points darting between all of
      those arrayed before it in turn, with a vaguely elliptical object for the
      mouth full of innumerable fanged protrusions, pushing forwards and back,
      switching places to reveal all new sets of hooked and vicious dentata.
      What expression that could mean was anybody’s guess. Sometimes, the eyes
      would droop to the sides and disappear as the jagged elliptical mouth grew
      to overtake the entire face, becoming a swirling mass of countless
      gnashing fangs. It seemed quite threatening. Still other times, the
      features would wash away to reveal almost nothing, only the hints of holes
      for eyes. But it was always changing, especially as it spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="small-caps">
        The time to fulfill yourselves has come. The last speaker to question
        the Omni Mutatio was given the honor of its intimate experience.
      </span>
      The mask fanned multiple serrated points outwards, making it look much
      bigger.
    </p>
    <p>
      A small, slender person in front, obscured by their cloak, responded with
      a voice that was both smooth and resonant. It had a breathy
      effortlessness, though when she spoke, it seemed to carry on the stone. He
      recognized it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “As I guide the city towards the tribute, I must ensure it remains virile
      and strong. I wish to contribute <em>more</em>, in ways that go beyond our
      time in the Depths. I do not question the authority of the Domitorem in
      any way. But by knowing its purpose, we can serve the cause the rest of
      the year, as well.”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Speaker Moltus. He supposed he should not be surprised she made it
      to the Council far faster than him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “This is ridiculous,” joined a large, portly man behind her. “We serve the
      Domitorem unconditionally and without question. His guidance is our light.
      Every moment of the blood sky is our divine right, our Rebirth,” he said,
      growing louder and straining his face, one hand pounding the wooden table
      before him with every emphasis. “Without our service, we have nothing – we{" "}
      <em>are</em> nothing. Do you presume you could <em>comprehend</em> the
      motives of the Domitorem? The arrogance is galling even for you,{" "}
      <em>Lady Tyrant</em>,” he said with a venomous emphasis on her title,
      which was met with a chorus of muttering around him and some heads nodding
      fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It doesn’t surprise me to hear this from the Speaker of the Apothecary,”
      joined another, a pale-skinned man with a gaunt, sallow face. He stood out
      from the sea of tepid brown as the only person whose garment was a deep
      shade of red. He had a half-smile that made him seem to relish the words
      that came next. “You have always been spared the Depths as long as you
      provide your poisons and blood magicks. Your family hasn’t served once for
      generations.” The room erupted with talk before a strong voice overpowered
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How dare you, Cazio? Lareth’s honor is unassailable, and his family has
      served the Domitorem for generations. His venerated status was earned. And
      what about your failures to control the Redcloaks? Your lot seems more
      interested in roaming the gutters looking for cast-offs and ferals than it
      is contributing to our great work.” A deeper, contralto voiced woman sat
      upright with shoulders angled directly at Cazio, the red-cloaked man. Her
      eyes were large and fierce, and they flickered as she spoke like firelight
      on the edge of a blade. A symbol like a star with infinite rays over a
      black moon was embossed on her tunic and cloak. The sigil of the Guild of
      the Caretakers of Law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cazio sat unmoved, staring at the woman with the same half-smile on his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Look, I make no argument that our service in the Depths is not the
      honorable work,” the Black Madonna interjected. “Your point is well
      marked, Talis and Lareth. What I ask for is simply knowledge, so that we
      may be empowered to contribute more. The knowledge I seek would only aid
      the Domitorem in our knowing. We have fought for centuries, beseeched by
      the Domitorem in the darkest time of our species, where we knew nothing
      but blood and stone. We sat like children in the dark, wandering the
      harshest wasteland, where we can no longer survive. He came to us to raise
      us into service – our transformation paying for the Epiphany. It is a
      great price to humanity that we gladly pay. How can I deny that we would
      be completely lost without the Epiphany? Had we been robbed of it, the
      grand city of First Child, twenty million people working in unison to form
      the greatest Tribute our kind has ever known, would be lost to the void.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He noticed that she was now standing up, though he didn’t remember exactly
      when that had happened. Her location in the front had served her, facing
      the entire Speaker’s Order with her back to the Elder, engaging them all
      as she spoke. She knew her audience. They sat in silence, easily cowed by
      the power of her speech. She stood straight, her chin pointed only
      slightly above a perpendicular plane to those who watched her, and looked
      them all in the eye in turn. Her long, jet black hair came through the
      folds of her cloak, as if it was slowly consuming her.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But we must also acknowledge the cost of our yearly transformation. The
      things that we have suffered, the things we’ve done against our will – it
      has left us overrun with the sick. Not just sick in body, but sick in
      mind. Suicides are a daily occurrence. No one sleeps. Every form of vice
      is practiced to the extreme, but none feel pleasure. There are so many
      sects that they are beyond number – and the rites and ceremonies that they
      perform can become so extreme in their attempts to weaken the influence of
      the Depths – many believe that by performing certain acts, they will be
      spared the worst tasks while transformed. I've seen it. I've seen it all.
      The streets are littered with refuse and the dead and dying. Those who do
      not kill themselves or starve, eventually lose their minds. They become
      ‘feral’ and prey on us in the dark. And there are even some, we know, that
      have peered too far into the Depths and seek to recreate the horror that
      they find there. We find people missing in the night, never to be seen
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But beyond that. I remember visions from my time in the depths as clear
      as if they were happening right now. The horrors we endure there are
      beyond comprehension. If we weren’t spared the full accounting of our time
      in the depths because of the mixture of senses, this city – our great
      Tribute – would be dust,” she said. She began speaking louder and quicker
      to cover the murmurings that began to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How am I to build our Tribute if we do not have people to build it? Every
      year, there are fewer workers. We can turn the city to corpses without
      scratching the surface of the Tribute’s destined height and power. Some of
      you have never made the sacrifice. There are good reasons we keep the
      Speakers lucid and human at all times. But I tell you from a purely
      practical stance: we cannot sustain this. We are in decline. If we do not
      do something, we will die.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The room burst into activity, many speakers jumping out of their seats
      with harshly contracted faces, pointing and waving aggressively at the
      Black Madonna, while others pulled at their cloaks, yelling their own
      grievances at the other speakers. The Initiate remained seated, glancing
      at the Elder who sat frozen, its mask mostly blank save for a small symbol
      of a triangle with three overlapping concentric circles directly in the
      center. The fires beside it flickered gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Black Madonna stood unaffected at the head of the room, slowly
      scanning the chaotic mass of speakers. When she got to him, she stopped
      for the briefest of moments, and he could feel her eyes pierce him to the
      core. Her face seemed to flash at him, as if it was a mirror that caught
      the light just so, and her face illuminated as she looked him in the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      A low grumbling and murmuring rose until it became almost deafening, when
      he realized the Elder was preparing to speak. He looked up and saw the
      flames beside the demon now contracting intensely.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="small-caps">
        If there is a failure to manage the city, it is yours. I would expect
        this from the redcloaks, but not from you.
      </span>
      The Elder’s mask blossomed with teeth and eyes that stretched in random
      directions to cover every part of its surface. Its exquisite antlers
      trembled as it spoke, sending black crimson trails pulsing down the side
      of its body.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="small-caps">
        We provide bountiful resources. We bring light where there is darkness.
        We ask–
      </span>
      it held up one atrophied crooked limb with a single digit extended from it
      like a crooked nose <span class="small-caps">–but one price.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was deathly silent. The loud arguing ceased immediately on the
      word of the demon sitting far above. Those who were standing remained so,
      waiting for the Elder to finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="small-caps">
        I am interested why you pursue this. Let us speak freely. Those who feel
        the Lady Tyrant's words served us, speak now.
      </span>
      The mask’s cluster of teeth had been replaced with a thin line surrounded
      by small flaps. It’s eyes shrank and became round, black pits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cazio, the smirking man in the red cloak, stood immediately, raising a
      confident fist into the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      “They serve us, Elder. I have seen the ravages in the margins of the city.
      We Redcloaks do what we can, but we are few. She speaks true.” He glanced
      at the Black Madonna, who gave him a curt nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another speaker rose from the back corner, a tall, hunched man who easily
      stood above the others. On his chest, he saw the symbol of two ravens
      facing opposite directions. The Guild of the Eyes of Dust. His voice had
      the texture of depthgate metal – harsh and twisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We have spent many years peering into the realm of the Domitorem,
      absorbing its truth. In our learnings, we have seen the necessity of
      cycles, and the feeding of cycles so that they can continue. We see the
      wisdom in the words of the Lady Tyrant.” The man bowed low as he finished
      speaking, bringing the arch of his back level with those arrayed around
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next the Cornmonger’s Guild, the Menders Guild, and the Guild of Silent
      Stars. As he watched the Speakers show their support, he noted how many
      sat with looks of contempt and disdain, grasping their cloaks tightly
      around them. Lareth, the Speaker of the Apothecary Guild, had his face
      contorted so tightly that it looked painful. His brows were brought low
      over his eyes, and his mouth curled tightly backwards. Talis, of the
      Caretakers of Law, sat emotionless but tall and confident.
    </p>
    <p>After a silence, the Elder spoke.</p>
    <p>
      <span className="small-caps">
        Honesty is rewarded by the generosity of the Domitorem. Your pleas have
        been noted. What cannot be ignored, however, are questions to our will.
        It is foul insubordination. Those who showed support are spared, but the
        Lady Tyran will be taken, and punishment meted out as according to the
        will of the Almighty Domitorem. Sanctum silentium.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      As it finished, the Black Madonna walked forward into the center of the
      room, steady and calm, betraying no sign of surprise. The Elder’s face
      grew long eyes drooping in a way he could almost interpret as sadness or
      mockery if it weren’t for the clenching fangs below.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the darkness of the far side of the room, he heard a rumble mixed
      with scraping on stone. From the distance in sound, he realized the
      darkness hid a room far grander in size than he first perceived. For how
      long that darkness reached, he could not guess. After listening for what
      seemed like minutes, a dozen demons larger than even the Speaker of the
      Eyes of Dust stepped into the light. They had large, gnashing faces whose
      eyes were clearly gouged out and bleeding; thick trunks for arms that
      featured claws the size of his head; and hulking bellies with demonic
      symbols carved in the flesh, pulsating with each step.
    </p>
    <p>
      They surrounded the Black Madonna and escorted her towards the darkness.
      She walked with her hood up, head facing down, at a slow and deliberate
      pace. The Elder waited until the sound of scraping claws was faint before
      speaking again.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span className="small-caps">
        We have concluded this discussion. There are other matters. We must
        perform the final rite on the Initiate and accept him into the Speaker's
        Order. Please, bring him forth.
      </span>
      The Elder’s mask hid its teeth and revealed four black eyes the size of
      coins.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was time. After his years of study, his years of suffering. He saw the
      life of a Speaker before him. The years of apprenticeship followed by
      years of governorship, leading a Guild and bringing the word of the Elder
      and the Domitorem to the people. No lack for food or shelter. No service
      in the Depths. There was no better life in First Child.
    </p>
    <p>But there was something else he had to do.</p>
    <p>
      The other Speakers watched in solemn silence as he stood and walked
      towards the throne. The Elder rose, it’s long arms extending straight,
      lifting the creature from its perch. It began its otherworldly locomotion
      spinning limbs over limbs, reaching down the side of a pathway that led to
      the floor. As it moved, it revealed a mass of rotten, limp appendages that
      streamed behind it like a river jellyfish. The limbs, unused, were broken
      and neglected, and looked as if they festered uncontrolled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Initiate took a small, sharp dagger he had hidden in his cloak and
      pressed it slowly against the inside of his wrist. He steeled himself for
      a moment, and pressed as hard as he could, feeling the tip of his blade
      touch bone. He felt the white hot rush of pain, so overwhelming that the
      edges of his vision faded to black. The taste in his mouth grew metallic,
      then dried as if he had eaten a handful of ashes. Symbols on his arm
      subtly glowed deep purple, indicating it had worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first part was done. The Elder was past the halfway mark, pulling
      itself around the final curve of the stone down to the ground, where it
      would approach him to perform the rite.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put the dagger back in the small pouch he had sewn on the inside of his
      sleeve, and took the other instrument he had hidden – a pair of pliers. He
      held them under his robe as close to his mouth as he could get, and
      waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Elder pulled itself next to him, and it was then he noticed the smell.
      It was unlike anything he had ever experienced. To say it smelled of death
      would be simplistic. It smelled as if a thousand bodies had been left to
      rot in the sun for months, and then drowned in the most putrid sewer water
      he could imagine. It hit him so hard he almost threw the pliers into
      himself in a reflexive attempt to stop it entering his nose. He resisted,
      barely.
    </p>
    <p>
      It pulled itself above him, coiling in its many limbs, its masked face
      staring down at him and revealing a complex lattice-work of teeth and
      symbols. The mask changed so rapidly, he thought he could see patterns in
      the motion, like reflections of the moon in rippled water.
    </p>
    <p>This was it.</p>
    <p>
      He opened his cloak, placed the pliers around his two front teeth, and
      pulled <em>hard</em>. He heard two cracks as the teeth came out and felt
      hot blood gushing from the open wounds. He pulled back his sleeve to
      reveal the deep knife cut in his arm, and jammed the two teeth into it as
      hard as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      All he could see was fire – a seething hot blaze that singed his beard,
      eyebrows and hair, burning his face as it gushed all around him,
      projecting a noise so loud his skull began to vibrate. Through the
      blinding light of the fire, he saw the Elder’s stone mask disintegrate,
      revealing a vile mass of countless eyes over a mouth lined by meter long,
      bloody protrusions that looked like elk horn without its velvet. It slowly
      peeled away to reveal the corrupt fibers underneath, until its whole body
      seemed to burn away completely.
    </p>
    <p>When the fire ended, his vision turned to black.</p>
    <Divider />
    <p>
      He did not dream, but he was lucid. There was nothing. Whether he lie dead
      or alive, whether it was his mind or some other horrible dimension, he did
      not know. Without a point of reference, he lost all concept of time. For
      how long he remained in this state, he could not say.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to feel something. Not much at first, just a vague sense of
      dryness in his face. Then he felt a coldness in his arms and his legs,
      lying limp on a flat surface, followed by the slow rising and falling of
      his chest. Once he felt his breathing, the pain hit him. It was
      excruciating. He realized the dryness of his face was actually intense
      pain, blooming through his body like ink injected into water. Every moment
      felt as if he was both being burned again and pressed against frigid ice.
      In order to distract him from the pain, he tried opening his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, he saw nothing but a blurry haze. After a few moments, he slowly
      resolved the outline of a slender woman sitting beside him, a small candle
      lighting her from beneath. She had black hair that swaddled her, almost
      consuming her. Regaining some piece of who he was, he recognized her as
      the Black Madonna.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t move. You will take long to heal, and even longer if you’re
      stubborn,” she said, spreading a light, semi-transparent blanket over him
      that soothed his pain immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to form words in his mouth, and at first, nothing seemed to come
      out but dust and dry wheezing. Eventually, he generated enough saliva to
      form words in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>“Did I kill it?” he said.</p>
    <p>
      She sat back down. “Yes and no. Elders don’t die as such. It will come
      back. But it will be diminished. It is no small feat to destroy the body
      of an Elder,” she said, pressing the blanket against his forehead, giving
      him precious relief from the pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I didn’t think I would survive,” he said, the words coming easier now.
      His face, however, never forgot to remind him of his condition as his
      muscles contracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There’s no guarantee you would have. But you did. You spoke in all
      languages. We chose rightly in you. And as I said, if you understood me,
      you would be protected.”
    </p>
    <p>
      {" "}
      “I don’t know if I do understand. But, I made a choice.” His mind flushed
      with fear. “Won’t the Domitorem transform us and destroy us? Aren’t we
      doomed?”
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her hand and looked at him. While it was hard to tell through
      the blanket and the dim candlelight, he thought she was smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We have ways of preventing the transformation. They are secrets passed
      down to us for generations. The Domitorem cannot find us here.” She began
      pressing against his forehead again. “We seek to overthrow the Domitorem
      and free ourselves forever.”
    </p>
    <p>
      It finally made sense. The mysterious visitor. The offer of vengeance. To
      hurt a demon for once – oh God, the horrors I’ve seen – I had to do
      something, <em>anything</em>. He thought of his brother, his head bobbing
      in a demon’s hand, and a hot rage rose up inside him.
    </p>
    <p>And for the first time, he realized he could fight them.</p>
    <p>“Where do I sign up?”</p>
    <p>
      She appeared to smile again. “Ah, see, that’s why I’m here. As I said,
      killing an Elder is no small feat. We have some things we would like you
      to do. If you help us, you will be part of our family and learn the
      secrets we keep in our struggle against the Domitorem. What do you say? Do
      you want it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited a moment, not to take any time deciding, but for added gravity
      in his answer.
    </p>
    <p>“More than I’ve wanted anything in my life.”</p>
    <p>
      She gave his head a final pat and rose, leaving the candle at his bedside.
      Before walking into the darkness, she looked down at him.
    </p>
    <p>“Welcome to the resistance.”</p>
