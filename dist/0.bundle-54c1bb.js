He continued, “It rises upwards, flanked by... runes. At the top is what many consider the ‘head,’ though it is obscured by a white cover that is tightly pulled. Through the cover, one can see a dozen holes near the top, and a single large hole near the bottom. Above the Domitorem is a double-helix of bones, collected from sacrifices in the Depths.

There were five rivers in the city of First Child, each forming a perfect circle around the city center in progressive rings. They were natural lines in the hierarchy between various guilds that governed each district of the city, the ones closer to the center, of course, being more important and influential. The river Kultata was the second from the city center and bordered the Apothecary Guild district on its outer side, where he now walked. The river had a luster like oil, being a solid, jet black, but glowed as it reflected the sun, refracting the light to give it’s own purples, greens and yellows. It flowed with a substance less viscous and more dense than water, which meant it was impossible to swim in.

If it wasn’t the dead soil, the constant storms or the all-encompassing fog, it was vicious predators perfectly adapted to the harshness of the environment and scouring every corner of the badlands. Instead, small pockets of agriculture existed within the city, especially among the Cornmongers Guild, supplemented by food provided by the Elder’s demon servants. From where they got the food, he didn’t know and didn’t want to. Still, the average citizen of First Child went hungry most days."),n.createElement("p",null,"He walked beside the river until the light began to fade and the path became more narrow, signaling that he was getting close to the edge of the Apothecary Guild district, where the Elder resided. When he looked up at the houses along the path, he could see the changes happening to the people already – those who watched the sky grew longer, scaly features; their eyes grew wide and vicious; their arms and legs wilted like they were left in the sun to rot, leaving only gnarled limbs like tree branches tipped with claws; their skin was scabbed and soaked with pus that ran from sickly brown boils. Their gazes, he could feel, moved gradually from the sky and onto him, the pits of their eyes shining in the background of pitch. They would soon be leaving their houses to join the others heading for the Depths. He turned his eyes towards the ornate, looming building of the Elder, which could be seen from miles away."),n.createElement("p",null,"The transformed others started to fill the paths, waiting in line to enter one of the many activated gates that dotted the public spaces across the city.

Walking through one would do nothing – not that anyone would ever try. People kept as much distance as they could from the metal gates."),n.createElement("p",null,"Now that the gate was active, the center was perfectly dark. Red tendrils reached from inside to grip the edges, pulsing and straining as if losing the edges would close it. Other tendrils wrapped the citizens as they entered the gate to pull them into the Depths. He saw the transformed citizens mauling each other as they stood in line, using their massive claws to rake the backs of the creatures in front, mouths open and fangs bared, tearing flesh. Other demons – servants of the Domitorem – carried long stakes made out of what looked like charcoal that they used to stop fights between the citizens, stabbing them apart before they did too much damage to each other. They didn’t get them all, however, as some of the citizens ripped each other apart too quickly, clawing into each other’s bellies and eating them from the inside, piles of gore developing on the edges of the crowd like the froth of a low tide."),n.createElement("p",null,"The demons policing the line looked similar to the transformed citizens, having the same wilted, lanky appendages; flaky, blemished skin and giant heads, their mouths filled with inch-long fangs that were always visible.

A rain began, escalating quickly from a gentle shower. Red beads splattered on the ground, and the clouds darkened as the moisture in the air coalesced into a storm.

It stood at least triple the height of the nearest building, boasting balconies, towers, exposed staircases, and outcroppings that brooded directly over its neighbors. While the indication of engravings covered every visible surface, the exact details seemed to fight the sense, slowly moving and merging as if it knew it was being seen. As soon as it looked like one thing, it seemed to subtly shift until it looked nothing like that at all."),n.createElement("p",null,"Walls of twisted vines and thorn obstructed the view of whatever courtyard the inhabitants tended, which he followed until he reached a tall metal gate.

He pulled away the canvas to reveal a dagger, about four inches in length, and a pair of pincers, which he placed into two pockets sewn into the sleeves of his cloak. They hung heavy, so he pulled his arm tight against him and held his sleeve from the inside with his hand before turning back to his original destination."),n.createElement("p",null,"He walked up to the gates of the leering tower and stood, looking through them.

He saw no activity within, hearing nothing but the sound of falling rain on stone."),n.createElement("p",null,"After a moment, he heard a loud click and watched the gate unhinge itself and open, drawing itself inward as if the courtyard was inhaling. He stepped through and followed the only path to the door."),n.createElement("p",null,"If the streets outside were poorly cobbled, this was much worse.

One more way to keep the Speakers in their place."),n.createElement("p",null,"Lining the path were multiple “structures” made from the bodies of imps – small, angular creatures with razor-sharp claws and two inch fangs. They had tufts of mottled fur on the ends of their tails and ears, along with patches over the body. They were bent and broken along the path to form arcane symbols, as if they formed a ward – or a curse. One symbol formed a circumscribed triangle with six imps on end, skewered down the middle on curved metal hooks, their limbs stretched, twisted, and clamped to other limbs by compressing a black metal instrument that looked like a bed of nails pushing through either side. Dried blood caked around the wounds and wove downwards in rivulets, long blackened from time. While he had no love for the mischievous creatures, who could be found in the dark corners of the city in roaming bands, he took no pleasure in seeing them treated with such cruelty.
