The drug, prepared for decades by the apothecaries, caused delusional visions of the mind akin to the horrors of the Depths.

This was the contract his people made at the beginning of history: the Domitorem and its demons from the other realms provide guidance, revelation, purpose and protection, and in exchange, the people of the city of First Child serve their tours in the Depths. Only a small group of “Speakers” would be kept lucid at all times to ensure the will of the Domitorem was done."),o.createElement("p",null,"As much as he tried to suppress it, he was overwhelmed with a feeling of relief.

The memories were tricky, as the transformation changed everything about the sense, but what little he remembered haunted him every night.

He could feel every piece of the air around him as if it were made of particles gently swaying, then jostled around as objects moved about in space. Rays would form in oblong patterns before him, not in any way he could see, but in ways that he interpreted as a type of distance-measuring sense.

It was a relentless, staccato eruption of alien sensation."),o.createElement("p",null,"But when the senses resolved, and his overstressed mind had a moment of lucidity, he could see the fringes of what he supposed were the tasks set before them in the labyrinthine Depths."),o.createElement("p",null,"It was suffering and pain."),o.createElement("p",null,"He remembered being cut open from top to bottom, down his limbs, across his scalp, and opened, his skin peeled back to reveal blood-slick muscle beneath – then singed on every nerve with instruments tipped with white-hot fires wielded by unrecognizable creatures, their faces a swirling mass of ripping flesh while a viscous black liquid streamed down in waves. His organs were sliced open, pulled apart and healed with forces he didn’t understand, then reconstituted and inserted back in.

Some believed that the citizens of First Child helped fight a war against the Domitorem’s enemies, perhaps to bring the same revelation and purpose it brought us. Others claim they served as subjects for the learnings of the Domitorem, so that it may find greater truths about the fabrics of reality. Still others claimed there is no purpose at all, and that the Depths were a realm of pure chaos. Regardless of the truth, the Elders have never revealed what the transformation is and what purpose it serves in the Depths."),o.createElement("p",null,"As he emerged from the cluster of buildings that bordered the street market, the statue known as the Tribute at the city’s center was framed perfectly. In the dreary red haze, four of its jagged, burnt red appendages thrust outwards in aggressive angles, forming the base of a tower that would ultimately rise above the clouds. The body of the tower depicted the Domitorem itself, and although no human had ever communicated with the Domitorem directly, its image was everywhere in the city and ingrained in the minds of the people of First Child."),o.createElement("p",null,"The margins of the Domitorem were the first thing the mind comprehended, having sharp protrusions running along its perimeter that stuck through complex webs intertwining in sharp patterns. The webs wrapped a bulging mass in the center that spilled through in drooling trails down its side and into its many legs, surrounding it like a curled centipede. The bulging mass and web rose upwards, flanked by demonic runes that even a Speaker did not have the privilege to understand. At the top was what many considered the “head,” which had a white cover tightly pulled over a vaguely spherical object. Through the cover, one could see a dozen holes near the top, and a single large hole near the bottom, creating indentations in the cloth that created pitch-black shadows. Above the Domitorem would rise a double-helix of bones and the prepared corpses of citizens and demons collected from sacrifices in the Depths. Ultimately, this double-helix would twist into the sky far beyond the sight, into realms higher than any human had ever been, but for now, the people of the city were still working on the first tier of the helix, one strand rising slightly above the other. There remained generations – tens of generations – of work."),o.createElement("p",null,"His route to the Elder would take him down the long path that followed the river Kultata. There were five rivers in the city of First Child, which formed perfect circles that circumscribed the city center in progressive rings. They formed natural hierarchies between the various guilds that governed each district of the city, the ones being closer to the center being more important and influential. The river Kultata was the second from the city center and bordered the Apothecary Guild district on its inner side, where he now walked. The river had a luster like oil, being a solid, jet black, but glowed bright as it reflected the sun, refracting the light to give it’s own purples, greens and yellows. It flowed with a substance more viscous and less dense than water, which meant it was impossible to swim in. However you flailed or struggled, regardless of how well you swam in water – if you fell into the river, you were sucked under, your arms and legs unable to push yourself in a liquid so weak.

Attempts in ancient times to settle outside the city met with universal failure. If it wasn’t the dead soil, the constant storms or the all-encompassing fog, it was vicious predators perfectly adapted to the harshness of the environment and scouring every corner of the badlands. Instead, small pockets of agriculture existed within the city, especially among the Cornmongers Guild, supplemented by food provided by the Elder’s demon servants. From where they got the food, he didn’t know and didn’t want to. Still, the average citizen of First Child went hungry most days."),o.createElement("p",null,"He walked beside the river until the light began to fade and the path became more narrow, signaling that he was getting close to the edge of the Apothecary Guild district, where the Elder resided. When he looked up at the houses along the path, he could see the changes happening to the people already – those who watched the sky grew longer, scaly features; their eyes grew wide and vicious; their arms and legs wilted like they were left in the sun to rot, leaving only gnarled limbs like tree branches tipped with claws, their skin scabbed and covered in pus that ran from sickly brown boils. Their gazes, he could feel, moved gradually from the sky and onto him, the pits of their eyes shining in the background of pitch. They would soon be leaving their houses to join the others heading for the Depths. He turned his eyes away from the others and towards the ornate, looming building of the Elder, which could be seen from miles away."),o.createElement("p",null,"The transformed others started to fill the paths, waiting in line to enter one of the many activated gates that dotted the public spaces across the city. He had never seen them active before. They were twisted, pockmarked horseshoes made of rusted iron, but in their dormant state contained nothing in the middle. Walking through one would do nothing – not that anyone would ever try. People kept as much distance as they could from the foreboding metal gates."),o.createElement("p",null,"Now that the gate was active, the center was pitch black. Red tendrils reached from inside to grip the edges, pulsing and straining as if it were holding onto the gate with all of its might. Other tendrils wrapped the citizens as they entered the gate to pull them into the Depths. He saw the transformed citizens mauling each other as they stood in line, using their massive claws to rake the backs of the creatures in front, mouths open and fangs bared, tearing flesh. Other demons – servants of the Domitorem – carried long stakes made out of what looked like charcoal that they used to stop fights between the citizens, stabbing them apart before they did too much damage to each other. They didn’t get them all, however, as some of the citizens ripped each other apart too quickly, clawing into each other’s bellies and eating them from the inside, piles of gore developing on the edges of the crowd like the froth of a low tide."),o.createElement("p",null,"The demons policing the line looked similar to the transformed citizens, having the same wilted, lanky appendages, flaky, blemished skin and giant heads, their mouths filled with inch-long fangs that were always visible. Their ears were each the size of their already freakishly large head, giving him the impression of a provoked reptile about to strike."),o.createElement("p",null,"He felt a drop on his exposed hand, then another. A rain began, escalating quickly from a gentle shower. It reflected the red sky like beads of blood, the clouds darkening as the moisture in the air coalesced into a storm. As the water began to pool around bodies of the dead, long, thin strands of red flowed through the channels of the cobblestone street like fresh watercolor, the gruesome art of the citizens’ new forms."),o.createElement("p",null,"As he approached the Elder’s tower, he saw how the extravagant architecture served less for shelter and more as a display of dominion and unmitigated power over all else. It stood at least triple the height of the nearest building, boasting balconies, towers, exposed staircases, and outcroppings that brooded directly over its neighbors. While the indication of engravings covered every visible surface, the exact details seemed to fight the sense, slowly moving and merging as if it knew it was being seen. As soon as it looked like one thing, it seemed to subtly shift until it looked nothing like that at all."),o.createElement("p",null,"Walls of twisted vine and thorn obstructed the view of whatever courtyard the inhabitants tended, which he followed until he reached a tall metal gate. It too had filigree that seemed to shift and undermine the sense, with the exception of a large, multi-sided polygon in concentric circles placed directly in the middle."),o.createElement("p",null,"He walked within a foot of the gates and stood, looking through. The low sun, peering through a gap in the clouds, cast oblique, red rays over the edges of the building’s gnarled features, illuminating the rain as it fell in a dull light. He saw no activity within, hearing nothing but the sound of falling rain on stone."),o.createElement("p",null,"After a moment, he heard a loud click and watched the gate unhinge itself and open, drawing itself inward as if it was inhaling.
